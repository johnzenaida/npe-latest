1. Unzip file and using an ftp program upload it to the wp-content/plugins/ directory then activate in plugins page.

3. Upload zip file through the standard plugins menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q) Should I network activate the plugin?
A) You may network activate the plugin so it is available on all sites or activate individually. When network activated there will be a new menu for the plugin under settings &#62; Network Posts Thumbnails which will allow you to give certain permissions to blog owners when it comes to the thumbnail sizes. You may allow to create new sizes just on their blog or across the entire network which will affect everybody. I recommend only to allow it for their blog only. This allows you to also include it as a custom feature if you want to charge for this capability.

Q) May I only include an x amount of posts that I choose?
A) Yes, use include_post= and put in your posts in comma separated format surrounded by double quotes.
Example include_post=&#39;5,78,896&#39;.

Q) My title is too long and looks ugly, anyway I can shorten it?
A) You may shorten it using the argument title_length=&#39;10&#39; will rounded it off to the last complete word before it reaches 10 characters.

Q) I would like to just show an X amount of random posts on the home page. Is it possible?
A) Use the following arguments: random=&#39;true&#39; and list=&#39;10&#39; will show ten different posts randomly whenever the page is loaded. If you add list=&#34;15&#34; it will show fifteen different posts randomly.

Q) May I order my posts in specific order by date or title?
A) Yes you may give specific ordering of your posts or pages via alphabetical order (by title), by date or page or post ID specific order.

Q) Does this plugin list pages from woocommerce?
A) Yes it now does as of version 0.1.4. You may list via page/post id or via taxonomy=&#39;custom woocommerce category&#39;. Woocommerce default directory/taxonomy is product show you would just use the argument taxonomy=&#39;Product&#39; which is the title of the directory. (Not case sensitive)
<strong>Note:</strong> Also works with Tips and Tricks eStore plugin.

Q) Will this plugin also include the prices from the products I create with the Woocommerce and eStore plugins?
A) Yes it will including the following argument: include_price=&#39;woocommerce&#39; or include_price=&#39;estore&#39;. If for some reason you have both plugins installed you would use include_price=&#39;estore|woocommerce&#39; if you want to list them both.

Q) When I use the following argument wrap_start=&#34;&lt;div style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt;&#34; and wrap_end=&#34;&lt;/div&gt;&#34; the text does not change color.
A) That is because since double quotes are used after the = sign  they must be changed to single quotes and use double quotes in the html. For example you would have to have wrap_start=&#39;&lt;div style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt;&#39;. Notice the double quotes in the html? Do not forget to change the closing argument to wrap_end=&#39;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;

Q) Does this plugin work with custom post types. That is post_type=&#39;custom-post-type&#39;.
A) Yes it now works with custom post types.

Q) Can I show full post from any blog on any site?
A) Yes you can by using the following argument full_text=&#39;true&#39;

Q) I have custom image sizes I have already created and uploaded. How can I use them with your plugin without having to go through the process of re-creating image sizes with your plugin?
A) You can use them directly as a featured image or you can install the plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-from-url/ and put in the link directly to the images. This plugin will automatically switch to the one listed here. Don&#39;t forget to change size=&#39;H,W&#39; to the dimensions of the featured image.

Q) The default layout is quite ugly. How do I improve it?
A) Using css I have made this plugin very flexible. It now contains two default layouts. Their names are &#34;default&#34; and &#34;inline&#34;. You may choose either one by using use_layout=&#39;default&#39; or use_layout=&#39;inline&#39;.

Q) Can I use shortcode attributes in dynamically created url?
A) Yes you may now use the shortcode attributes in a url. Example: http://localhost/wordpress/home-page/?column=infinite&include_blog=1,2,3&taxonomy=wordpress-develop,second-posts

Q) Where do I put the shortcodes?
A) Paste the shortcode on any page, post or custom post type using the <strong><em>Text</em></strong> not the <strong><em>Visual</em></strong> area of the posts editor field.

Q) How do I use this plugin in widgets?
A) Use the default WordPress text widget and post the code in there under the <strong><em>Text</em></strong> not <strong><em>Visual</em></strong> code area so it will not mess with the shortcode. This widget is now automatically shortcode ready. No need for a special widget or plugin to activate shortcodes in widgets.

Q) Is it possible to include custom post type meta information?
A) As long as you use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Advanced Custom Fields Plugin</a> it will be possible to do so. Read the readme.txt file for arguments to add to the shortcode.

== Changelog ==
= 6.2 =
Fixed function which ACF changed on update so to be compatible again.

= 6.1 =
Added the ability to output numerical and simple text based strings from the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. Important: Won't do complicated fields because the output will just be converted to a long text string which will look like gibberish.

= 6.0 =
Put back the class for the read more link. Verified stability with WordPress 4.9.8

= 5.9 =
When title was set to contain a link it lost it&#39;s class so added a new class called &#34;netsposts-posttitle-link&#34; to make the customization via css easier. So when title is not linkable the class is &#34;netsposts-posttitle&#34; and when it is a link the class is &#34;netsposts-posttitle-link&#34;.

= 5.6 =
Changed some css by changing the following html code: id=&#34;block-wrapper&#34 to class=&#34;netsposts-block-wrapper&#34; and id=&#34;netsposts-paginate&#34; to class=&#34;netsposts-paginate&#34; and id=&#34;netsposts-menu&#34; to class=&#34;netsposts-menu&#34;

= 5.5 =
Added two new arguments &#45; hide_source=&#39;true&#39; hide_excerpt=&#39;true&#39;. Default false &#40;will automatically show hide_source and hide_excerpt unless set to &#39;true&#39;&#41;.

= 3.9 =
Added the ability to create custom fields and order your posts as such. For example if you create a custom post type to show upcoming events you can list them in either ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending) order. Plus you can show past events or events that are occurring today. Plus changed the link structure from using post ID to using permalinks.

= 3.8 =
Fixed bug where post_height=&#39;&#39; stopped working.

= 3.7 =
Added the ability to keep original image quality in plugin admin menu. Keep original image is defaulted to on and by-passes WordPress automatically choosing compressed version of image. Check the box to turn this feature off.

= 3.6 =
Added ability to open links in new window.

= 3.5 =
Updated way WordPress runs shortcode to keep up with security standards plus fixing taxonomy error. Now compatible with WordPress version 4.8.3. Plus added to be able to call taxonomies by keyword using partial category/tag name.

= 3.4 =
Fixed error in show_categories php code which was showing parse error in error_log file.

= 3.3 =
Fixed use_shortcode_in_excerpt function now works again. Added the argument show_categories so if you would like to include a link to the category page you may add show_categories=&#39;true&#39;

= 3.2 =

Fixed syntax error created in some environments.

= 3.1 =
Corrected the ability to process shorcodes in the excerpt field. Now must use: use_shortcode_in_excerpt=&#39;true&#39;. You must use a plugin like &#60;a href=&#39;https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/&#39;&#62;Code Snippets&#60;/a&#62; or add the following code to your functions.php file which allows you to process shortcodes in the excerpt box of posts and if activated pages also. &lt;?php add_filter&#40;&#39;the_excerpt&#39;, &#39;do_shortcode&#39;&#41;; ?&gt; without the backticks. The above plugin will not want you to include the &lt;?php and ?&gt;. Just enter it as so: add_filter&#40;&#39;the_excerpt&#39;, &#39;do_shortcode&#39;&#41;;. If your functions.php file has an opening php tag just insert the latter snippet also.

= 3.0 =
Added the ability to process shortcodes in the excerpt field. Just set filter_excerpt=&#39;true&#39;. That is if you have a shortcode in the posts excerpt field in the admin page or have auto_excerpt=&#39;true&#39; it will process all shortcodes.

= 2.9 =
Added ability to use shortcodes in dynamic url.

= 2.8 =

= 2.5 =
Fixed bug where content was flowing outside of content area when listed on a page.<br>I have added the following arguments:
* full_text=&#39;true&#39; will show entire blog content &#40;default - false&#41;
* use_layout=&#39;&#39; &#40;default or inline - the default is set to use_layout=&#39;default&#39;&#41;. When set to inline all meta data and content will be aligned to the right of the image.
* align_thumbnail=&#39;&#39; &#40;default is left. May now choose the image to align to the right of the text if use_layout=&#39;inline&#39; is chosen.
* wrap_excerpt_container_start=&#39;CSS Code Here or anything else for that matter&#39; wrap_excerpt_container_end=&#39;&#39;. So if you want to add a class to the excerpt/content area you may do so by using wrap_excerpt_container_start=&#39;&lt;div class=&#39;custom-class&#39;&gt;&#39; wrap_excerpt_container_end=&#39;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;.

= 2.4 =

This way you can remove the read more links from the excerpts by using the following attribute:

show_categories &#150; If set to true will also include a link to the category archive page. show_categories=&#39;true&#39; default is false.

Added ability to call all categories that contain certain keyword or part as in the following example:If you type &#39;test-%&#39; it will find test-1, test-2, test-3 etc.I.e. it will find categories that starts with &#39;test-&#39;. if you type &#39;%test&#39; it will find categories that ends with &#39;test&#39; word.

Wants created you must include the following in your shortcode:thumbnail=&#39;true&#39; size=&#39;Name of Alias&#39;. For example if what is listed in the alias box is 600x400 then it would be size=&#39;600x400&#39; so your thumbnails will have a size of 600px wide and 400px high. You may change the diplayed size of these images using custom css.For example you may create a class called img-size-300x200 and change the displayed image size thus: .img-size-300x200 &#x7b; height:300px;width:200px; &#x7d;. Then add this to the shortcode: image_class=&#39;img-size-300x200&#39;.
align_image=&#39;right&#39;,align_image=&#39;left&#39;.
use_layout=&#39;default&#39;,use_layout=&#39;inline&#39;<br><br>

Advanced Custom Fields - To add the field with the meta info just use the argument include_acf_fields='name-of-custom-field-slug'. It will appear with the label name followed by the input (default false). If you'd like to include the label just add the argument hide_acf_label=&#39;false&#39;.
Note: All fields are surrounded by &lt;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt; tags. If you'd like to change them you will have to add a bit of coding. Here's some examples.<br><br>
/* Beginning Explanation of Code<br><br>

add_filter('netsposts_get_acf_html', 'print_acf_html', 10, 2);

function print_acf_html($fields, $post){
$html = '';
foreach($fields as $field){
$html .= '<div>' . $field['label'] . ': ' . $field['value'] . '</div>';
}
return $html;
}

or even

function print_acf_html($fields, $post){
$html = '<div>';
$html = '<p>';
$html .= $fields['some_field']['label'];
$html .= '</p>';
$html = '<p>';
$html .= $fields['some_field']['value'];
$html .= '</p>';
$html .= '</div>';
return $html;
}

include_acf_fields='some_field_1,some_field_2'<br><br>

End explanation of code */<br>

Note: Replace some_field with the actual field name. Don't replace anything else.<br><br>
